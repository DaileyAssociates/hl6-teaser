## Development Environment
Ensure you have Node (version greater than 8) and NPM installed, and run `npm
install` from the root directory to install the dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm run start` to start up the
development environment, with live-reload.

## Production Build
To compile the project for production, run `npm run build` from the root
directory. This will create a `build` directory in the root with all assets.
